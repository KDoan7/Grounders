Developed with Unreal Engine 5.
Unfinished and currently worked on Unreal Engine 5 project written in C++ and blueprints. Started this project to learn C++ programming and the Unreal Engine. Majority of current preliminary code is done in blueprints and will be updated to be written in C++ once the project is in a fully playable state.
The end idea for the project is a multiplayer game meant to resemble professional tag but with parkour movements such as wall running/climbing and a grappling hook.
